Hi, I’m Chris and I come from Austria. I bought my US Golf in 2012 on the World Wide Web, actually by an accident.

At this time the Westy was completely inconspicuous.

#### Starting from the outside

Mine comes with a KW Static suspension, and it’s rolling on custom 17“ Sebrings. It has 1991 widening and G60 fenders all around. It has the Westmoreland front-end with, and in the back, it has a set of smoked US taillights. The paint is also quite recent, being made back in 2013, with the original Tornado Red (Y3D) color.

#### What about its engine?

At the beginning, it was an automatic, 1.8L RV. It was first my daily driver, so I changed from the 1.8 RV engine to a 2.0 2E, but kept the automatic transmission. After a while, and because I was looking for that G60 sound, I decided to build this Westy as good as I could, keeping it original, simple and classic.

Swapped the engine for a 1.8L G60 PG, and fitted a manual 5 speed gearbox. Regarding engine mods, it had a [**Schrick Camshaft**](http://www.schrick.com/index.php), a 4bar petrol pressure regulator and adapted the control unit.

#### How is it inside the car?

It came fully equipped for that time!

Currently it has:

* Power Steering
* Anti-lock braking system
* Central locking system
* Sunroof
* Corrado electric Recaro leather seats with rear headrests
* Full leather interior
* 4 electric windows and electric mirrors
* Cruise control
* Air conditioning
* Headlight washers
* And the black roof headliner

#### Some final thoughts?

I’m actually very happy with my Golf! All the missing things and parts are now there and complete, and there’s nothing I would change right now.

Maybe, in the future, I might give the braking system an upgrade, or perhaps get a new set of wheels!

Thank you so much for your time Chris, and congratulations for such an awesome looking Golf, those Sebrings are fantastic!
