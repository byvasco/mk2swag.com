##### How/why did you started taking pictures?
Always fancied it as a hobby So I got myself a cheap bridge camera and started from there

##### Is this your profession, side hustle, or just a hobby?
It’s not my full time profession yet, but I hope one day that it will be, it’s all I want to do.

##### Do you specialize in automotive? Or do you also do other types of photography?
I like taking photos of everything, any subject the more diverse the better, I do however do a lot of automotive photography as I am a big petrol head anyway and there’s nothing quite like the buzz of your photos being in a magazine. I also do weddings, baby photos,family photos and everything in between. I am passionate about photography in general.

##### Have you ever owned, or own a MK2?
Yes I have and still do, I own one currently . I’ve spent nearly 7 years restoring and modifying it and i would never sell it.

##### What gear do you use?
Currently I’m shooting with a Nikon D800 full frame and about 5 or 6 different lenses , plus lighting , flash kit or car rig depending on the shoot. I also carry a back up dslr camera on me in case I’m on a shoot and have an issue.
I use Adobe Lightroom primarily for editing and also Adobe Photoshop.

##### How can people reach out to you for work?
I’m contactable via my email
