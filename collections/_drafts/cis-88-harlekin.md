When I was 17 and learning to drive, I was looking for my first car. There was a MK2 with a 1.3 carburetor from 1985 in a Sky blue color and I fell in love with it. I bought the car, and just after a couple of times driving it I just knew I was going to love this car.

It was great to drive! After getting my licence I lowered her and put on some copper colored banded steelies and I just loved it. But after 2 years I found more and more rust so I had to let her go. So I was looking again for a MK2 and I came on the one I have now.

She is also a 1.3 carburetor but a 5 door from 1988.


#### Your ride is obviously quite out of the ordinary. Why did you go with the Harlekin look?
Haha yes, that's the most common question I get.

When I went to one of my first meetings with my father and my brothers, before my first car, I saw an Harlekin themed Passat and I told my dad that I wanted one too. But none of us knew what it was. After I got into the VW scene, I came across other cars in these colors and I found out they where Harlekins! So I started looking for them, but I couldn't leave the MK2 group. 

Because I was looking for a new MK2 after I sold the blue one, I looked for a 5 door and after I bought it, I looked for someone who would paint my Golf in these ridiculous colors. And then it all started again â€” suspension, wheels and interior had to change.


#### Besides the different panel colors, what else has changed on the outside?
Not a lot, actually. The rear wiper and the plastic trim on the doors were removed, and I went from small bumpers to big bumper just at the end of this summer (2019).


#### I love the Mercedes wheels. What are their specs? And tires size?
These are called Gullideckel (manhole cover in German), and came originally on Mercedes from the 80s.

In this case, they're 16x7.5 with an ET of 51, and because they are 5x112 and the Golf is 4x100, I needed some adapters â€“ 20mm in the front and 25mm in the rear. They were powedercoated in white with a polished lip.

And the tires are Nankang NS20 165/45 for all 4.


#### Regarding suspension, is it static or on air?
Due of the laws in Belgium, air suspension is not legal (being this low in static is also illegal, but oh well). And because I was still in school, I had no money for air so I went with new [AP Coilovers](https://www.apcoilovers.com/).

Now the new wheels are much wider, so I had to go with solid bumpstops in the rear. And yes it drives very hard ðŸ˜‚.


#### Let's talk about mechanics. What's under the hood?
It's was originally a 5 gear carburated 1.3. But the gearbox had a lot of play, and at that time I had a MK2 with a 1.6 for spares with a good engine and transmission we just swapped it. So it's now just a 4 gear carburated 1.6.

I like the sound of a VR and I have thought a lot of times buying one, but never did it. It will stay like it is now until I find the right one!


#### How is it inside your ride?
The front seats are Recaros from an Alfa Romeo with custom frames to fit the Golf. Steering wheel is (will be added) with a selfmade horn decal. I have a Votex center console fitted with 3 VDO gauges. It also has a MOMO Harlekin colored shifter, and I painted some parts to fit the rest of the car.

In future I want to get a full custom interior made in all the different colors.


#### What are your plans for the future of your Mk2?
Now, we are talking about a couple of years, but first I have a Kamei X1 bodykit that I want to put on, the full custom interior, and also I'd love to have a cleaned engine bay (colormatched, of course!).


#### Want to leave us some final words?
I want to thank my two brothers, Jef and Wannes, for all the help they all have given and will give in the future. I also want to thank my parents for let us use the garage for all our parts!
