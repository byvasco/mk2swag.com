My name is nick, Im from staten island NY i own a 1991 Mk2 golf. My car was originally the S&L Imports 1.8t orange mk2 built back in 2004. I bought it off someone back in 2011 with the intentions of enjoying a built car but that didn't last long.

#### What exterior mods does it has?
Due to bad body work and prehistoric shaved bay wiring i got sick of dealing with the cars issues and made the decision to start over. The car was stripped to the shell and put on a rotissory rack. New paint work on everything inside, out, and underneath. Along with a custom firewall and shaved bay.


#### What about engine mods?
The motor is a 12v Vr6 with a custom ITB set up. Every component on the motor is either powder coated or chrome plated. Endless amounts of one-off parts. Tons of fabrication work done over at swoops built. Wiring work done by Matt at EuroKraft performance. The motor modifications list can go on forever so i will let the pictures tell the story. Simplicity was deffinetly the goal with the motor.


#### And the interiors?
The interior of the car took allot of work to make it look as simple as is does so far. The AB&C pillar body lines were all shaved smooth eliminating the interior trim. The roof was cut off the car. Replaced with a custom carbon fiber panel eliminating the headliner. The floor in the rear seat and truck section has all the body lines filled and shaved smooth along with a custom seat delete panel. All thats left on the interior is a dash, door cards and 2 seats. Upholstery work by loves trim shop. Center console was removed, shift box hole was welded shut and in its place is a CAE shifter & hydraulic Hand brake. The pedal box was removed and replaced with a over hung wilwood hydraulic pedal set up. Custom bolt in cage with a B pillar mount for added strength. Cage also built by greg over at Swoops Built.


#### To finish things up
This car has been nothing but work and fustration since 2011 and the build is still going to this day. All of it wouldn't be possible with out the help of talanted friends. I want to thank Tom from Espo's Powdercoating, Matt from Eurokraft, Kip from Loves trim, Greg from Swoops built, Dave from slaw built, James from Xclusive, Frank from shore polish, Joe from garage jobs, Miguel, and everyone els that helped along the way so far.
