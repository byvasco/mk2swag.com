My dad bought me this when I was 13 for me to drive it until I wanted a new car, and 10 years later I still own it.

Both of us have built this from the ground up; we painted it and have done everything on it.

I’ve got so in love with MK2’s that I’ve bought a couple of Jetta’s and a Polo, and Golf will never be for sale no matter what – it’s 
part of the family now.


#### What exterior mods does it has?
It’s got a BBS bodykit with a Westy front headlight set up.

At the front there's a Kamei hood scoop and a US spec bumper. In the back, the tail lights are US spec too, it has a window Louvre and a Hella style rear spoiler. And it also has a Polo 6N open air cut in the roof.

And it sits on a set of D90 Porsche wheels, with static suspension and with a bit of rear camber.


#### What engine is it running?
It started its life with a 1.6 and that was fine, nice and reliable. But then I bought an [TSR 8V 1.9](https://tsr-performance.com/donnington-1-9-litre-8v/) with twin Webber 40’s, then semi-smoothed the engine bay and painted it chocolate brown.
Lastly, I also had a custom 3” exhaust made for it.


#### And the Interiors?
Inside there's VR6 leather interiors that were died in brown. It also has a custom steering wheel and a Syncro dash panel with the Vortex centre console, and a Digifiz cluster.


#### What's next? What are your plans for the future of your ride?
It’s done to a point. I have to take care of the interior as I’ve got some stuff to finish, then it’s a new wheel set up (I need to hit my goal of running 10” wide on the rear) and then I’ll probably leave it alone. Unless I find an 2.0 ABF.

After that, I will finish my MK2 Jetta build and probably start another one!
