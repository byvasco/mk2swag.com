I started taking pictures in high school it was awesome developing my film in the darkroom which later evolved into the digital world over the years.

##### Is this your profession, side hustle, or just a hobby?
This actually started as a hobby but after I had a chance to venture out and start marketing myself it led to some great opportunities as profession like taking pictures at birthday parties, weddings, covering live music, naacp banquets, and automotive events.

##### Do you specialize in automotive? Or do you also do other types of photography?
My main passion is automotive photography as I frequently attend automotive events and as a car enthusiast I have a great appreciation for the automobile!

##### Have you ever owned, or own a MK2?
I have cherished these cars even at a young age and I currently have 3 other VW’s currently a Mk4 golf tdi, a Mk6 golf GTi, and a Mk6 golf R  but my favorite generation is my mk2 Jetta GLI!

##### What gear do you use?
I shoot nikon i have several different bodies and a vast collection of nikon lenses. If i had to say my go to is my nikon D700 with the 24-70mm lens attached is the most versatile set up i use to shoot most of my shots with.

##### How can people reach out to you for work?
I have an active Instagram account [@tony_watson_photo](https://www.instagram.com/tony_watson_photo/) and a Facebook photography page solely dedicated on social media at TonyWatsonPhotography
I’ve been published in VolksAmerica magazine and Performance VW magazine several times this past year and my work will be in two more issues in the next upcoming months as well.
