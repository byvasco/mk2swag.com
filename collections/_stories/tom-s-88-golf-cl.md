My name is Tom, I’m from Ipswich Suffolk UK and I own a 1988 Mk2 Golf CL.

I was not ment to own this car as I had saved my money to buy a 6 speed Volkswagen Lupo GTI. In 2007 I had my heart set on a anthracite blue 6 speed GTI but the owner selling was very unrealistic with the price. At the time it was the only one for sale and he wouldn’t budge on the price. I was scouring ebay one night and this local gold Mk2 Golf appeared. As I read through the description and looked through the photos, I just knew I had to have it. Agreed to view the Golf the next day and bought it there and then.

Let’s start from the exterior I’ve had the front wiper blanking grommet smoothed, rear washer jet and wiper smoothed and the radio antenna as well. I also added the GL chrome trim on all the windows, and fitted the chrome trim 7 slat grill.
