My name is Andre. I'm from Nuremberg, Germany and I own a '91 Mk2 Vr6 Turbo. I own the car for 8 years and it's my first Volkswagen.

#### Let's start from the outside. Talk to us about it!

It's painted with an 18 years old color named Petrol Blue Metallic from Ford.

The car stands on 17" BBS E87 lightweight racing wheels, it has fully painted front and rear bumpers from the GL model and also a Votex rear spoiler, refined with real carbon fiber. In the rear, it also has a rare set of Red&White tail lights.

And overall, there are some more parts in carbon fiber.

#### What's under the hood?

The engine is a 2.8 VR6 (AAA) with a Garrett gtx3076 turbocharger and a full 3" catless exhaust system.

It has mostly stock parts and its making around 500PS (493BHP) and 700NM (516FT-LB) of torque.

#### The only thing left is the interiors. What can you tell us about it?

The whole interior is in a club Clubsport racing style.

It has Recaro Pole Position seats, racing steering wheel, OMP seatbelts, a CAE shifter, and many many carbon fiber parts. Even the whole Clubsport cage is covered in real carbon fiber.

#### To finish things any, last thoughts?

There are many things I have to do â€“ such a project is never ready.

It's all about details. ðŸ˜Š
