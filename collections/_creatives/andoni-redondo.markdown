##### How/why did you started taking pictures?
I started taking pictures, about 2012, with very amateur results. At that time in my environment I didn't know any photographer and I didn't have much information either.

I don't know why I started in the world of photography, but it all started by photographing a mk1 golf that I had at that time. I liked having photos of him and at the beginning most of my photos and videos were from that car and the events he attended with him.


##### Is this your profession, side hustle, or just a hobby?
Photography is not my profession. Yes, I've done different jobs in a "professional" way, but for now it's just my hobby.

I really like to generate photographic content, and I would like that one day it could be more than a hobby. someday.


##### Do you specialize in automotive? Or do you also do other types of photography?
I like different types of photography, landscapes, portraits, night photography seems impressive, and I really like building photography. But with none I have managed to devote as many hours as with car photography.


##### Have you ever owned, or own a MK2?
In 2008 I bought my first car, it was an MK3 GTI. 6 months later I bought a mk2 gti, I have a nice memory because with everything started, the world of forums, meet people related to the world of golf, modifications ...

then I had a mk2 gtd as daily

In 2010, I bought an mk1 cabrio and it was with this car that I started seriously in the world of modifications, absurd suspension height, wide wheels ...

I've been going to events without a car for a few years.
today I am with a project of a jetta mk1 coupe abf. I hope it doesn't take much longer to leave ...


##### What gear do you use?
I use a canon 60d. the 90% of time I use sigma 30mm 1.4 lens. I really love this lens. For the rollings usually use sigma 10-20mm f3.5.
