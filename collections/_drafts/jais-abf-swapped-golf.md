Hey I'm Jai, I'm from Northampton UK, and I own a MK2 Golf with a 2.0 ABF. I always wanted a MK2, and I’ve been the owner of this car for almost 5 years now.

I grew up around these cars as a lot of my mates that were older had these growing up and would pick me up and we would go out driving for fun and I just fell in love with them.

My mom used to drive a black Scirocco Scala. It was mint and, we had that in the family. And the fact that my brother has been a complete VW enthusiast and had a Corrado and other cars growing up, it eventually led me to get the the car I always wanted – the MK2 Golf.

After searching for a while, I found the right one. Got it trailered back (it didn’t run) from Malvern, and it needed a lot of work to get it to how I wanted it.

It was originally an automatic 1.6 driver but had had ABFs and VRs put into it by previous owners, so the wiring was a mess and there were a lot of things missing. On the bright side, the shell was mint and that meant I could mould the car to fit my vision.


#### What exterior mods does it has?
This car used to be a driver, so it had the bigger door mouldings and all those standard things. The arches were removed and changed for G60 ones, and the bigger door mouldings were replaced by GTI ones.

Smoothed out the front bumper for a cleaner look and the fog lights were removed. The rear bumper towing recess was taken out for a cleaner look as well, along with the rear boot plinth lock (which was also smoothed).

It has a Rallye front end but I only use it for shows. For daily use I’ve got it with the normal round lights.

I've also deleted the rear wiper, and probably some other stuff I’m forgetting.

Oh, and it's sitting on 15” OZ Turbo wrapped with Hankook and Toyo tires.


#### What about engine mods?
Under the bonnet it has a 2.0L 16V ABF from a Mk3 Golf GTI. It’s standard but the engine bay has been tidied a lot and most wiring run through the chassis leg.

It's still quick to be honest, as MK2s don’t weight much and it’s so fun to drive because it loves to rev. This is all hooked up to a full Jetex exhaust system that sounds quite nice to be honest.

The car runs pretty good as it has an hydraulic clutch, so it feels nice to drive.


#### And the interiors?
When I got it, the car never had an interior, so I literally had to start from scratch.

My brother welded seat brackets in from a Polo (which funnily enough are the same), and I managed to come across a pair of electric Recaro from a MK2, so that was decent.

The headliner was retrimmed by me and my brother, done with black perforated leather.

It also had a 280 Momo steering wheel but it was stupidly small so changed it for a 320 and feels so much better.


#### To finish things up
The car is never going to be finished as I’m always finding new things I want to do and new parts I want to install.

In the near future it will be an engine change and possibly wheels too. Eventually the interior will be retried as well.

I'd like to get another MK2 to be hones, and possibly go a different route or something that’s original like a nice factory spec. For now this car is more than enough and puts a smile on my face every time I drive it ;)
