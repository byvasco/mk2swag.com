##### How did you started taking pictures?
Always fancied it as a hobby so I got myself a cheap bridge camera and started from there. It‚Äôs not my full-time profession yet, but I hope one day that it will be, it‚Äôs all I want to do.

##### Do you just do automotive, do you also like other types of photography?
I like taking photos of everything, about any subject ‚Äì the more diverse the better.

However, I do a lot of automotive photography as I am a big petrol head anyway and there‚Äôs nothing quite like the buzz of your photos being in a magazine.

I also do weddings, baby photos, family photos and everything in between. I am passionate about photography in general.


##### Have you ever owned, or own a MK2?
Yes I have and still do, I own one currently. I‚Äôve spent nearly 7 years restoring and modifying it and I would never sell it.


##### What gear do you use?
Currently I‚Äôm shooting with a Nikon D800 full frame and about 5 or 6 different lenses, plus lighting, flash kit or car rig (depending on the shoot).

I also carry a back up DSLR camera with me in case I‚Äôm on a shoot and have an issue.

For editing, I mainly use Adobe Lightroom for editing and also Adobe Photoshop.


##### How can people reach out to you for work?
I‚Äôm contactable via my email or any of my social media ‚Äì I‚Äôm on Instagram [@wellchuffedmedia](https://www.instagram.com/wellchuffedmedia/) and I‚Äôm on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WellChuffedMedia/) too.

Just drop me a message if you‚Äôd like to chat about a shoot of any kind, I‚Äôd be happy to help üëçüèª
