intro: A G60 US Spec Golf in Austria.

---
Hi, I’m Chris and I come from Austria. I bought my US Golf in 2012 on the World Wide Web, actually by an accident.

At this time the Westy was completely inconspicuous.

#### Starting from the outside

Mine comes with a KW Static suspension, and it’s rolling on custom 17“ Sebrings. It has 1991 widening and G60 fenders all around. It has the Westmoreland front-end with, and in the back, it has a set of smoked US taillights. The paint is also quite recent, being made back in 2013, with the original Tornado Red (Y3D) color.
