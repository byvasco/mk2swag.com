My name's is Jack, I'm from Cannock Staffordshire, and I own this MK2 Golf. I wanted one as far back as I could remember, but didn't want to buy one that had been messed with so I could do it my self.

Bought the car about four years ago and it was in a sorry state of affairs – both sides were keyed, the bonnet was all dented, and the boot was in the same state. But it was solid, so I brought it and started to work on it, and that's how it all started.

Everything I've done to it has been done by myself with the help of my dad who is the same as me – he loves cars and owns a MK2 that is cleaner then mine!


#### Exterior
It's sitting on a set of 15” BBS RM, 9J at the rear and 8J at the front. They were completely standard wheels when I bought them, so stripped them, painted and installed wider dishes to make them sit fatter on the car.

I then decided to stealth the front by using black headlight covers, giving it that aggressive look. I also decided to drop the car on Airlift Performance 3P Management so I could drive low but park lower and get that arch-to-lip fitment on the rear.


#### Engine
It's an original 1.8 engine on Webber carbs. I took the engine out to tidy everything up, and ended up rebuilding it, painting all the engine bay and just bought everything new.


#### Interiors
The interior is a bit of working progress. Need to get the boot build done nicely, and get the seats re-trimmed. But at the moment it has a mini sport steering wheel, Sparco R333 front seats and leather back bench. Soon it will be even nicer, as got loads of ideas for it


#### Conclusion
The car is still an on-going project and I’ll be forever changing parts (when I can afford it ahah). But like I said before – it's the interior that’s the next thing to take care of. After that it will be an engine transplant to give me some more power and some life again!
