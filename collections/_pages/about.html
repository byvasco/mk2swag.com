title: About MK2
intro: All about sharing the passion for MK2 Golfs and Jettas, from all around the
  world.

  I'm Vasco, a designer from Portugal and also the dude that started Mk2Swag.

  My first car, a 1990 Golf, was bought in July 2015 in pretty rough shape, something you can usually expect from a 400€ purchase. To my surprise, the car was relatively good, mechanically speaking, and is still alive in the day of writing this. After I bought the car I immediately started to search and save a lot of images of other MK2’s, and almost 2 years later I decided to open Mk2Swag’s Instagram account as a way to share those images and to connect with the community.
