My name is Nick, I'm from Staten Island, NY and I own this 1991 MK2 Golf.
It was originally the [S&L Imports 1.8t orange MK2](https://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?4775151-s-l-imports) built back in 2004. I bought it off someone back in 2011 with the intentions of enjoying a built car but that didn't last long.

#### What exterior mods does it has?
Due to bad body work and to a pre-historic shaved engine bay wiring, I got sick of dealing with the cars' issues and made the decision to start over. The car was stripped to the shell and put on a rotissory rack.

New paint work on everything inside, outside and underneath, along with a custom firewall and shaved bay.

#### What about engine mods?
The motor is a 12v VR6 with a custom ITB set up. Every component is either powder coated or chrome plated.

Endless amounts of one-off parts, tons of fabrication work done over at [Swoops Built](https://swoopsbuilt.com/).

The motor modifications list can go on forever so I will let the pictures tell the story. Simplicity was definitely the goal.

#### And the interiors?
The interior of the car took a lot of work to make it look as simple as it does so far.

The A, B and C pillar body lines were all shaved smooth, eliminating the interior trim. The roof was cut off the car and replaced with a custom carbon fiber panel, eliminating the headliner.

The floor underneath the rear seats and the trunk section had all the body lines filled and shaved smooth, along with a custom seat delete panel.

All that's left on the interior is the dash, door cards and the front seats. Upholstery was all work by [Loves Trim Shop](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Loves-Trim-Shop/873915899394650). Center console was removed, shift box hole was welded shut, and in its place is a [CAE](https://cae-racing.de/) shifter and an hydraulic hand brake.

The pedal box was removed and replaced with an over hung [Wilwood](https://www.wilwood.com/) hydraulic pedal set up, and it has a custom bolt-in rollcage with a B pillar mount for added strength (built by Greg over at [Swoops Built](https://swoopsbuilt.com/)).


#### To finish things up
This car has been nothing but work and fustration since 2011, and the build is still going to this day.
