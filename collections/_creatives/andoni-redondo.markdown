##### How/why did you start taking pictures?
I started taking pictures around 2012, with very amateur results. At that time in my environment I didn't know any photographer and I didn't have much information either.

I don't know why I started in the world of photography, but it all started by photographing a MK1 Golf that I had at that time. I liked having photos of him and at the beginning most of my photos and videos were from that car and the events he attended with him.

##### Is this your profession, or just a hobby?
Photography is not my profession. Yes, I've done different jobs in a "professional" way, but for now it's just my hobby.

I really like to generate photographic content, and I would like that one day it could be more than a hobby. Someday!

##### Do you specialize in automotive? Or do you also do other types of photography?
I like different types of photography â€“ landscapes, portraits, night photography seems impressive, and I really like building photography. But with none I have managed to devote as many hours as with car photography.

##### Have you ever owned, or own a MK2?
In 2008 I bought my first car, it was a MK3 GTI. 6 months later I bought a MK2 GTI. I have a nice memory because of everything that started to know with the world of forums, meeting people related to the world of MK2s, etc.

Then I had a MK2 GTD as daily and in 2010 I bought a MK1 Cabrio and it was with this car that I started seriously in the world of modifications, absurd suspension height, wide wheels and all that.

I've been going to events without a car for a few years because I have an on-going project â€“ a Jetta MK1 Coupe ABF. I hope it doesn't take much longer to get done!

##### What gear do you use?
I use a Canon 60d. 90% of time I use a Sigma 30mm 1.4 lens. I really love it. For the rolling shots I usually use a Sigma 10-20mm f3.5.
