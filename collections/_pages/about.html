  <p class="body">I'm Vasco, a designer from Portugal and also the dude that started Mk2Swag.</p>
  <p class="body">My first car, a 1990 Golf, was bought in July 2015 in pretty rough shape, something you can usually
    expect from a 400€ purchase. For my surprise the car was relatively good, mechanically speaking, and is still alive
    in the day of writing this. After I bought it I immediately started to search and save a lot of images of other
    MK2’s to get inspiration for my own car, and almost 2 years later I decided to open Mk2Swag’s Instagram account as a
    way to share those images and to connect with the community.</p>
  <p class="body">Today, after the purchase of my second Golf, the passion for these old metal boxes is even bigger.</p>
