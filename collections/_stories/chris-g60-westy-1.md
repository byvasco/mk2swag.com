I’m Chris, from South Wales in the UK, and I’ve owned ‘Heidi’ for 16 years.

When I was in school this car was parked not far away and I always told myself that one day I would buy it. Sure enough, when I turned 18, the car came up for sale and I scrambled all my cash together to go buy her.

The panels’ color were a bit faded, and it had a misfire at 3000rpm (which turned out to be the head gasket). I ran her as a stick GTI 8v for a few years, and I installed a set of coilovers, and lights, keeping her a bit cal look.

After my daughter was born I took her off the road for a rebuild, and turn her into something unique that I loved and wasn’t done before.

I love muscle cars and Nascar, so that was the basic inspiration for how she looks now. The build took 7 years, with a bit of wiring help from friends. And after those 7 years, I finally achieved a look that I love and wanted.

#### What changed after you bought her?

So, from the factory, this was a big bumper Tornado Red GTI on BBS RAs. But I then changed a few things and ran her with a set of ATS Cup and FK High Sports for a few years. After she came off the road, I stripped her back completely.

Here’s the list of parts she now has:

* Fk Street Line Coilovers
* 8×15 Extreme Offset Wheels, painted and detailed at home
* 205/50/15 595 RST Tyres
* Smoked X-hair headlights
* 16V Rear Lights
* G60 Arches
* North Viking Brake Ducts
* Custom Chin Spoiler
* One off fully adjustable nascar wedge
* One off grill badge
* Full Custom Motorsport [**Prospeed Exhaust**](http://www.pro-speedexhausts.com/)
* Cult Society Rear plinth
* Boot Top Spoiler Delete
* Custom Side Trim
* Custom Headlight Covers
