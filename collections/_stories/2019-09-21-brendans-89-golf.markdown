My name is Brendan, I’m from Simi Valley CA, and I own a 1989 Volkswagen Golf.

I used to ride by this car on my bike every day when I was 15 years old. It never moved. The last time it had been registered was 1999. I would knock on the door every few months, trying to convince the owner to sell it to me.

By the time I was 18, he finally agreed. I had it towed home that night.


#### How it looks from the outside
My favorite thing about the car is definitely the paint. A buddy of mine helped me strip down all of the original white paint, and spray it black magic pearl inside and out. We shaved a lot on the car in the proccess, but didn’t go overboard with it, and it has a set of 15 inch BBS RS wheels sitting under the G60 flares.

#### Any engine mods?
Even though it sat for almost 20 years, I was able to get the original 8v in the car to run. It never ran quite right though. I got so sick of not driving the car due to little qwerks, so I decided to ABA swap it for reliability. As long as I live in California, I think it’ll have the ABA in it. Its still a fun little motor for what it’s worth, and I don’t have to worry about a state referral.
Eventually I’d like to 1.8t swap it, but that won’t be for a while.
