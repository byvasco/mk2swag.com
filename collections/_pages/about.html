      <p>
        I'm Vasco, a designer from Portugal and also the dude that started
        Mk2Swag.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first car, a 1990 Golf, was bought in July 2015 in pretty rough
        shape, something you can usually expect from a 400€ purchase. For my
        surprise the car was relatively good, mechanically speaking, and is
        still alive in the day of writing this. After I bought the car I
        immediately started to search and save a lot of images of other MK2’s,
        and almost 2 years later I decided to open Mk2Swag’s Instagram account
        as a way to share those images and to connect with the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, after the purchase of my second Golf, the passion for these old
        metal boxes is even bigger. Hope you can all enjoy Mk2Swag as much as I
        do, and thank you for being a part of it!
