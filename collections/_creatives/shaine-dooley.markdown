I really started to take pictures when my dad and I would go to car shows. He took pictures with his Canon Rebel and was always so intrigued on the whole idea of taking photos. Ever since it really stuck and I hope to be doing it as my profession.

##### Is this your profession, side hustle, or just a hobby?
This is my hobby as of right now but I’d really love to turn it into my profession in the near future. Just the idea of my job being something that I really love and enjoy is so important I feel.  There’s nothing better than making money from something you really enjoy doing.

##### Do you specialize in automotive? Or do you also do other types of photography?
Mostly right now I do automotive photography and cinematography. The reason I chose this path is because of my love for cars. I’ve always loved cars, ever since I was a little kid. And it’s such an amazing community to be apart of. I also enjoy nature photography and portrait photography.

##### Have you ever owned, or own a MK2?
Yes!! At the time I have two. A 1987 Golf GT, and a 1992 Jetta.

##### What gear do you use?
At the moment I use a Sony A6300 with the Sony 18-135mm f3.5-5.6. The gimbal I use is a DJI Ronin S. And the drone I use is the DJI Maverick Air. Yes I do edit my photos and videos. For video, I edit with Final Cut Pro X. And for photos I use Adobe.

##### How can people reach out to you for work?
People can reach out to me on any of my social media’s. That includes [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scrapinmedia/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/scrapinmedia/), and Email. I will get back to you as soon as I can.
